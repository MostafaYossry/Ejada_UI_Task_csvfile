Hello I'm Mostafa Alsaddek 
=========================
I create this new application to use CSV file that contain the test data, as after spending many hours I can not make the Scenario outline read the CSV file
So I make one step in feature file then read the CSV inside the Step Definition file, so it's consider as one TC
in the main task I use scenario outline with example, each example act as different scenario.
=========================

In this project, I use Eclipse, Java, Cucumber, and JUnit runner.
I develop this framework in Page Object Model

I make Login scenarios
I implement 4 TCs like to show different messages per each case of inputs.

You can get the feature file in (src/test/java/featureFiles/Login.feature)
	
I make a static wait of 3 seconds in the last step of each scenario before closing the window to notice the end of each scenario.

I create a configuration file that contains the website URL, the Test Data File Path, and the Driver location for Chrome and firefox, my code select the driver based on Driver value here.

As this is a POM, I create a class for each page of the application. in this case one class for one page Login page
each class contain the page elements and the action on these elements, so I can use them in test cases
You can find them in pages package (src/main/java/pageFiles) 

As this is a Cucumber I create the step definition file in sdFiles package (src/main/java/stepsDef) that contains the actions for each command in the feature file.

I use a local report after each run in HTML, you can find the test report in (target\cucumber-reports\cucumber-html-report.html)
========================================================================

To run this application you need to import the project to Eclipse then Go to the Runner file (src/test/java/runner/RunnerFile.java) then run as "JUnit Test"
-------------------------------
I attach "chromedriver" and "geckodriver" to this project in resources package (src/test/java/resources)
-------------------------------
Note: I use Windows and Eclipse IDE for Java Developers Version: 2024-09 (4.33.0)
